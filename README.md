# Advent of code 2020

I have been thinking about learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for a while now... 
and [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020) is just the right opportunity!

Hence in this repo I collect my solutions. Just for myself.

> I heard it gets really tough and hence *time-consuming* towards the end, so I am not going to solve all puzzles :christmas_tree:
